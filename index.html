            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p id="p"> When my parents/owners came to pick me up they were expecting a male golden retriever puppy, they clearly were mistaken. My sister (Isabelle) one year before this moment had written apersuasive text to my dad that we should get a dog. Isabelle had always loved animals and had learnt so much about dogs in her encyclopedia book about dog breeds. she ;eft the note on her dad's study desk and waited.Until a few days later her dad mentioned it. They talked about the pros and cons and when Isabelle was finnaly able to convince her dad she was over the moon and started finding family-friendly dogs from the enclyclopedia. Sitnce her dad had, had a dog when he was kid they were thinking of getting a similar breed to a labrador, so they chose a golden retriever. They immeidiatly started looking for breeds and thought of having a girl, but then suddenly changed there mind to a boy because we didn't want to de-sex her. They soon started thinking of male dog names until they found the perfect one, Yogi.</p>
            <p id="p"> The night they were meant to oick me up the sisters had a fight to who wound come with my dad to pick up 'the dog'. When Isabelle had finally won the arguement it was already 10:00pm and they had to pick her by half past ten. So they rushed to the location and waited in the car for a long time, and I know what you're thinking, you think we missed the time and they had already left the location. WRONG! Luckelly the breeder was just late and when my dad finally brought me into the car I was so scared I early peed my pants and I could see that they realised it, but it didn't make it any better when Isabelle kept saying "it's okay little guy, it's okay little guy" but I couldn't speak, an even I could they wouldn't understand me, so I just sat there with a small toy beside me and a pee mat on the car seat.</p>
            <p id="p"> The next day I was so excited and the mat was so fun I loved to roll on it and when my dad saw this he realised I wasn't a boy. I had many nipples and had no 'thingy'. My dad looked at me and thought that we had picked up the wrong dog, but they didn't, the breeder got mixed up and gave us a girl. When my mum found out, as a family we had to change the name we had been planning for the past few months. MY mum thought of my name. Marley. She got it from the movie 'Marley and Me'.</p>
